# Android Media Store Updater

If you've transferred some pictures to your Android phone and they don't show up
in the photo gallery, they might not have been added to the internal media
store. This app fixes that. Run it once, and it'll search through `DCIM/Camera`
and `Pictures`, adding every file it finds.
